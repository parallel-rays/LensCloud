# Enhancing Image Reconstruction Quality with AI-Based Image Signal Processing
---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Modern digital cameras rely on Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines to convert raw sensor data into high-quality sRGB images. However, traditional handcrafted ISP modules like demosaicking, denoising, white balance, tone mapping, and color correction often fail under challenging conditions such as low-light environments.

This project tackles the issue of learning **RAW-to-sRGB mappings** when training data suffers from **spatial misalignment and color inconsistency**, a common problem especially with images captured via Androidâ€™s Camera2 API.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop a complete deep learning-based system that:
- Enhances image reconstruction from raw data.
- Corrects color misalignment and artifacts.
- Integrates into both Android and web applications for real-world usability.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Application

Our system allows users to capture raw images on mobile devices and get high-quality, color-corrected sRGB versions via a server-based AI model. This enables:
- Improved image quality in poor lighting.
- Advanced image enhancement on consumer devices.
- Easy access to professional-grade image processing.

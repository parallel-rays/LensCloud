below is a approach used to determine the bayer pattern
sufficiently red, blue and green images were captured
these files are directly from a smartphone camera
these are raw images the smartphone transfers over the network

the bayer pattern is as follows

[[3, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 2],
[0, 1, 0, ..., 1, 0, 1],
[3, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 2],
...,
[0, 1, 0, ..., 1, 0, 1],
[3, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 2],
[0, 1, 0, ..., 1, 0, 1]]

the bayer raw image is composed of repeating bayer pattern
for red
the value at 0 was consistently seen higher

for green
the values at 1 and 3 were consistently seen higher

for blue
the value at 2 was consistently seen higher

so, now it is clear that the pattern is

G B
R G

or RGBG 

There is reason to believe that the zrr dataset is of the form

B G
G R

GRGB

So, rotating the original image's each of the 2 by 2 matrices by 90 degree anti clockwise
will do the following
RGBG to GRGB 

G's may not always lie diagonally in which case flips and transposes may be needed
